# Penalty Shootout

My project I based on my favorite sport!

In this game, you will face off against a goalkeeper. Your goal is to score as many goals as you can out of 5 penalty kicks. There are 4 spots you can shoot and the keeper has a random chance of going to 1 of the 4 spots.

The game was built using Java 11 and Macalester-Specific Graphic API.

## Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to understand Object-Oriented Programming a lot better. As I designed the game from the ground up, I was able to plan ahead as to what classses I would need and what methods would go where. This also allowed me to better my Java development!


## Run Locally

- Clone the project

- Store it on your local machine in whichever folder you wish

- Open in any IDE (IntelliJ or VScode)

- Go to ```PenaltyGame.java``` in the ```src``` directory and go all the way down in the source code and click run on top of the ```main``` method.

- Use your mouse to hover to any 1 of the 4 hightlighted spots and click to shoot. You get 5 kicks. If the ball goes in one of the spots and keeper goes in another you score a goal, otherwise it is saved. After 5 kicks, you will see your score in the terminal.

- Enjoy!
